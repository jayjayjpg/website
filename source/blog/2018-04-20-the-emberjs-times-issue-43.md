Ola Emberistas!

This week we try out another format for the newsletter and bring it right to the
Ember blog, to make it accessible to even more Ember enthusiasts in the community.

And this week we not only have news about the 2018 roadmap for Ember CLI for you,
but also updates on new exciting RFCs in Emberland and
last, but not least, a brand-new Readers' Question about contributions for you.
Here's what's happened this week:

## [The Road Ahead for Ember CLI in 2018](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-cli-2018-edition/14543)

This week the Ember CLI team has published their *official roadmap* for the
command-line tool to keep the Ember community posted on which shiny new things
might be landing in an Ember app near you soon.

The current project goals for 2018 include a dedicated migration story to
[Module Unification](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/143), enabling
[Treeshaking](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/pull/110), adding service worker support
to the blueprint of Ember apps by default and many other exciting topics.

You can read more about the roadmap on the [Ember Forum](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-cli-2018-edition/14543)
and leave your thoughts and suggestions in the comments below.
